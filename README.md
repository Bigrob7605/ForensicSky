# ForensicSky - Pulsar Timing Array Analysis System

**Status: 🔬 RESEARCH IN PROGRESS - NO DISCOVERIES CLAIMED**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS IS**

A **research-grade PTA analysis pipeline** for investigating cosmic string signatures in pulsar timing data. This is a **scientific tool**, not a discovery announcement.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Real IPTA DR2 data loaded and processed
- ✅ Correlation analysis implemented
- ✅ Statistical validation methods in place
- ⚠️ **No cosmic string detections confirmed**
- ⚠️ **No claims of discovery made**

---

## 🚀 **CORE SYSTEM COMPONENTS**

### 1. **Core Analysis Engine** (`01_Core_Engine/Core_ForensicSky_V1.py`)
- Real IPTA DR2 data processing
- GPU-accelerated correlation analysis
- Statistical significance testing

### 2. **Data Management** (`02_Data/`)
- IPTA DR2 pulsar timing data
- Parameter files (.par)
- Timing files (.tim)
- Clock files (.clk)

### 3. **Analysis Results** (`04_Results/`)
- Correlation matrices
- Statistical analysis outputs
- **No confirmed detections**

### 4. **Visualizations** (`05_Visualizations/`)
- Sky maps of pulsar positions
- Correlation network plots
- **No cosmic string maps (no detections)**

## 📊 **CURRENT FINDINGS**

**What we have found:**
- 30 pulsars successfully loaded from IPTA DR2
- Correlation analysis completed
- Statistical patterns identified

**What we have NOT found:**
- No confirmed cosmic string signatures
- No gravitational lensing effects
- No network topology detections

**Important:** The 31.7% anisotropic clustering mentioned in previous documentation was **not a cosmic string detection** - it was a statistical pattern that requires further investigation and validation.

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNINGS**

1. **No Discovery Claims:** This repository does not claim to have discovered cosmic strings
2. **Research Tool Only:** This is a scientific analysis tool, not a discovery announcement
3. **Statistical Patterns:** Any patterns found require rigorous validation before interpretation
4. **Peer Review Required:** All results must undergo proper scientific peer review

---

## 🔬 **SCIENTIFIC APPROACH**

This project follows proper scientific methodology:
- Real data analysis only
- Statistical significance testing
- Null hypothesis testing
- Reproducible results
- Open source code

**No predetermined conclusions about cosmic strings.**
