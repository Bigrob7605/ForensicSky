# Quantum System Purge Report

**Date**: 2025-09-05T20:32:43.778900
**Reason**: Quantum kernel method failed validation - produces false positives

## Summary
- **Files purged**: 2
- **Archive location**: 08_Archive/quantum_systems_purged
- **Status**: Quantum systems successfully purged

## Purged Files
- PURGE_QUANTUM_SYSTEMS.py
- QUANTUM_SYSTEM_PURGE_REPORT_20250905_203023.md

## Validation Results
The quantum kernel method was tested with comprehensive validation and failed:

- **Hub scores identical** for noise and signal (all ~1.000)
- **No statistical difference** between any conditions  
- **Hub identification random** (25% success rate)
- **Method produces false positives** consistently

## Conclusion
The quantum approach requires real quantum hardware to be meaningful.
Classical mathematical transformations labeled as "quantum" are not valid.

## Next Steps
Focus on established classical PTA methods:
- Hellings-Downs correlations
- Cross-correlation analysis
- Red noise modeling
- Proper statistical validation
